# Chapter 2 Notes

## 2.1 - Goals, Principles, and Patterns
* Class definition specifies data fields and methods that an object can execute
  * **Data fields** - Variables that store the object's state
  * **Methods** - Functions that define the object's behavior
### 2.1.1 Object-Oriented Design Goals
* Software implementations should achieve robustness, adaptability, and reusability.
  * **Robustness** - Software should be able to handle unexpected inputs and conditions.
  * **Adaptability** - Software should be able to change in response to new requirements. Also called evolvability.
    * Related concept is portability, which is the ability to run software on different hardware and software platforms.
  * **Reusability** - Software should be able to be used in multiple contexts, especially if the code can be used as a component in other software systems.
