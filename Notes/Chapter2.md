# Chapter 2 Notes

## 2.1 - Goals, Principles, and Patterns
* Class definition specifies data fields and methods that an object can execute
  * **Data fields** - Variables that store the object's state
  * **Methods** - Functions that define the object's behavior
### 2.1.1 Object-Oriented Design Goals
* Software implementations should achieve robustness, adaptability, and reusability.
  * **Robustness** - Software should be able to handle unexpected inputs and conditions.
  * **Adaptability** - Software should be able to change in response to new requirements. Also called evolvability.
    * Related concept is portability, which is the ability to run software on different hardware and software platforms.
  * **Reusability** - Software should be able to be used in multiple contexts, especially if the code can be used as a component in other software systems.
### 2.1.2 Object-Oriented Design Principles
* The three main principles of OOP are Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Modularity
  * **Abstraction** - Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, and working at the most relevant level of inheritance for a particular aspect of the problem.
  * **Encapsulation** - Hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interactions to be performed through an object's methods. Useful for ensuring that the object's state is consistent while making relativlety local changes to the object's implementation.
  * **Modularity** - Dividing a program into separate modules that can be developed, modified, and tested independently. 
### 2.1.3 Design Patterns
* Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are not finished designs that can be transformed directly into code, but rather templates for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
